Description
-----------
This module only hides single nodes identified by their node IDs from the
search result.

If you have other or further requirements (like hiding nodes by node type) 
check out the custom search module: 
- http://drupal.org/project/custom_search

Prerequisites
-------------

The Search module has to be enabled.


Installation & Configuration
----------------------------

1. Enable the module.
2. To add nodes to the exclusion list, simply visit the modules configuration
   page at Administration > Configuration > Search and metadata > Exclude nodes
   from search by node id.
3. Use the node title lookup to search for the nodes you want to exclude. After
   adding the node IDs, save the form.
